# CPS_Project
Project for the cps exam. 

The problem addressed in this project is the movement of a damped pendulum inside a non-inertial frame. The control problem consists in maintaining a certain angle of the pendulum by controlling the acceleration of the moving system.

PID controller is implemented and evaluated. Requirements are written in STL and monitored using MoonLight.
